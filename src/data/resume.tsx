        "Currently Flutter developer. I love building things and helping people. Sometimes I go to the gym.",
    summary: "I graduated from high school in May 2021. After a month, I started working as a Junior Front-end Developer at Qodeca. For less than two years there I gained experience under the guidance of great people, experts in their fields. A few months later I ended up full-time at THOC Ltd. where I slightly changed my direction and started working with Flutter.",

                    The House of Code - the place where my career took an exciting turn.

                    I initially joined as a React and React Native Developer, working on various projects. After some
                    time, I switched to Flutter, which was a completely new experience for me. With the support of my
                    amazing colleagues, I quickly adapted to the technology.

                    Today, I primarily focus on Flutter development, but I also occasionally contribute to projects
                    using other technologies like Vue.js

                    Junior Frontend Developer, 2021 - 2023

                <p>
                    I joined Qodeca right after graduating from technical school. It was here that I faced the reality
                    of real-world projects, which were quite different from those on Udemy courses. As a beginner, I
                    learned a lot from the experienced people I worked with.

                <p>
                    At Qodeca, I primarily worked as a Junior Frontend Developer with React and Next.js, but also gained
                    experience with React Native. This role was foundational in building my skills and confidence in the
                    industry.
